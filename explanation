class TupleSorter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tuples = []
This line defines a class named TupleSorter. It serves as a container for the methods and data related to sorting tuples.
The __init__ method is a special method called a constructor that initializes an instance of the TupleSorter class.
The constructor sets up an empty list called tuples as an attribute of the TupleSorter instance.


    def sort_tuples(self):
        sorted_tuples = sorted(self.tuples, key=self.sort_key)
        return sorted_tuples
This method, sort_tuples, sorts the tuples based on the provided criteria.
It uses the built-in sorted function to sort the self.tuples list.
The key parameter is set to self.sort_key, which is a method that defines the custom sorting criteria.
The sorted tuples are stored in the sorted_tuples variable and then returned.


    def sort_key(self, tuple_data):
        gender = tuple_data[3]
        name = tuple_data[0].lower()
        age = int(tuple_data[1])
        height = int(tuple_data[2])
        return (gender, name, age, height)
This method, sort_key, extracts the relevant fields from a tuple and returns a tuple of values.
It takes tuple_data as a parameter, which represents an individual tuple.
The method extracts the gender, name (converted to lowercase), age (converted to an integer), and height (converted to an integer) from the tuple.
It returns a tuple of the extracted values, representing the sorting criteria.


    def input_tuples(self):
        while True:
            input_str = input("Enter a tuple (name, age, height, gender) or press Enter to finish: ")
            if not input_str:
                break
            tuple_data = tuple(input_str.split(','))
            self.tuples.append(tuple_data)
This method, input_tuples, allows the user to input tuples and stores them in the self.tuples list.
It uses a while loop with the condition True to continuously prompt the user for input.
The user is asked to enter a tuple in the format "name, age, height, gender" or press Enter to finish.
If the user presses Enter (leaves the input empty), the loop is terminated using the break statement.
The input string is split by commas using the split method to create a list of values.
The list is converted to a tuple using the tuple function.
The tuple is appended to the self.tuples list.


    def print_sorted_tuples(self):
        sorted_tuples = self.sort_tuples()
        for tuple_data in sorted_tuples:
            print(tuple_data)
This method, print_sorted_tuples, prints the sorted tuples.
It first calls the sort_tuples method to obtain the sorted tuples.
Then, it iterates over each tuple in the sorted_tuples list and prints it.


# Create an instance of the TupleSorter class
tuple_sorter = TupleSorter()

# Input tuples
tuple_sorter.input_tuples()

# Sort and print the tuples
tuple_sorter.print_sorted_tuples()
These lines create an instance of the TupleSorter class called tuple_sorter.
The input_tuples method is called on the tuple_sorter instance to input tuples.
Finally, the print_sorted_tuples method is called on the tuple_sorter instance to sort and print the tuples.
